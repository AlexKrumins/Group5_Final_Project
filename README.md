## First Segement
### Presentation
Selected Topic: 
  Personal Key Indicators of Heart Disease
Reason for Topic: 
  Heart Disease affects us all and we have each been affected to various degrees by this disease.
Source of Data Description: 
  The data source contains 18 variables with Heart Disease as the first column which is the Explanatory Variable.
Questions they hope to answer with the data:
  1. What are the top contributors to Heart Disease based on the features of this data set?
  2. What are the least contributing features in this data set?
  3. What combinations are the worst for Heart Disease outcomes?

#### Communication Protocols
- Slack for the main discussion
- Git hub for commenting on code additions
- Zoom for screen-sharing

### Tech Overview - Hannah

### GitHub - Alex
One challenge facing the team in this assignment is the (potentially) daunting task of collaborating via GitHub. At times, GitHub can seem overwhelming to newcomers first learning & navigating the environment. Leveraging the experience of [AlexKrumins](https://github.com/AlexKrumins), the group will use GitHub not only as a repository for storing data, code, and analyses but also as a learning tool to develop the necessary practices for safe and secure code development.

### Machine Learning Model - JB

### Database - PostgresSQL - Sara

### Visualization - Tableau

# Machine Learning Model
Team members present a provisional machine learning model that stands in for the final machine learning model and accomplishes the following:
- [] Takes in data in from the provisional database
- [] Outputs label(s) for input data

# Database 
Team members present a provisional database that stands in for the final database and accomplishes the following:
- [] Sample data that mimics the expected final database structure or schema
- [] Draft machine learning module is connected to the provisional database
