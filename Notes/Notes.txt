Once the challenge of the data set selection is complete it is now time to determine the best application of machine learning for the project. Between the two choices there is supervised or unsupervised. 

#### Unsupervised Machine Learning
 The detailed discussion concerning the attributes of unsupervised machine learning models are outside the scope of the project however it is important to note that unsupervised machine learning best suits projects centered on transforming dat to create approaches to intuitively analyze or structure whole data sets into clusters or patterns.

#### Supervised Machine Learning 
in a supervised machine learning environment the input data is refined into paired outcomes. The paired outcomes then provide a "supervised" lens that facilitates the training and test of the supervised machine learning model to predict potential coorelations using new data.
For the purpose of the project, Team 5 will aplly supervised machine learning in accordance with the below graphic.

In the above graphich the team has designed the project into 3 phases

*1 Training Phase
In this phase the team selected a dataset that provides cleans and paired date where the Y (dependent) and X (independent) variable are available. Once all of the identified datasets are cleaned and processed the data set is divided into a ttrainingn set and testing set.  According to the KU Boot Camp documentation it recommends a 70% training set to train the model.

*2 Validation Phase
 This phase applies the model's learning algorithm to the remaining 30% of the given data set. In essence the data is known and the team is testing the model to ensure outputs are inline with defined data.  Assumptions about the dataset, conditions, and hypothesis begin taking shape.

*3 Application Phase
Once the model has passed the validation phase, it is now time to apply a new data set. Standard data pre-procession of the data set is required to ensure the data is cleaned and aligned to make the machine learning process effective. the final phase provides a machine learning solution to the new data set and present potential prediction of conditions relevant to the variables and environmental influences.
